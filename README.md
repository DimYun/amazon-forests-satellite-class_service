# Type of Amazon forests satellite image. Service

FastAPI service for Amazon forests satellite image 
[NN multilabel classification](https://github.com/DimYun/amazon-forests-satellite-class_model). 
I made accent on "industrial quality" code with next technologies:

* FastAPI
* Gitlab CI/CD (test, deploy, destroy)
* DVC
* Docker
* Unit & Integration tests with coverage report
* Linters (flake8 + wemake)

**Disclaimers**:

* the project was originally crated and maintained in GitLab local instance, some repo functionality may be unavailable
* the project was created by me and me only as part of the CVRocket professional development course
* this project is my first "industry grade" service for NN, for more advanced code and features please see [car-plate projects](https://github.com/DimYun/car-plate_service)
